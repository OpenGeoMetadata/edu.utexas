The bulk of this correspondence dates October 1913-June 1915. Names of individuals have been normalized and formatted in Last Name, First order. Locations listed for communication creators and recipients have been georeferenced. Unidentified locations have been identified as such and geolocated in Austin, Texas as a default so that records can appear in mapping exercises. GIS approximations for some unidentified locations have been determined by referencing contemporaneous (+/- 2 days) communication that did indicate location."
