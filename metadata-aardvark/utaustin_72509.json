        "The map was based on the Castro Speech Database, which is hosted in the Latin American Network Information Center (LANIC), LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections.  The map includes a subset of 78 buildings related to the speeches given by Fidel Castro. The buildings were identified by their names in the speeches and georeferenced. Out of the 52 that were located, only 34 of them have an exact location; the other 18 are an approximation based on additional research and given the location of a city. Out of the 26 unidentified locations, 22 of them were given the location of the city or province, and 4 of them were given a location on the sea south of Cuba to represent the entire dataset. The speeches date February 1960-December 1994."
